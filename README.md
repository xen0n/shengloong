# 昇龍 (Shēnglóng; ShengLoong)

**昇龍** upgrades your LoongArch system with outdated glibc symbol version *in-place*,
to a newer symbol version, so you don't have to re-install from scratch.
For everyone else this is pretty much useless.

**昇龍** (Simplified Chinese: 升龙) means "rising dragon", also literally
"upgrade loong", which is exactly what this tool does.
