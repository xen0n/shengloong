**昇龍** upgrades your LoongArch system with outdated glibc symbol version *in-place*,
to a newer symbol version, so you don't have to re-install from scratch.
For everyone else this is pretty much useless.

**昇龍** (Simplified Chinese: 升龙) means "rising dragon", also literally
"upgrade loong", which is exactly what this tool does.

I delibrately chose the traditional characters for the name, even though
most LoongArch users are probably more used to Simplified Chinese, because
the name does not sound "too literal" this way. Plus, the "rising sun"
connotation seems good for such an emerging architecture.
